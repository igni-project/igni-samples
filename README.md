# igni-samples

A set of programs that showcase the Igni computing environment

## Running the Program

If a SUP display manager is already installed and active, simply run the built executable in `src/`. If no such display manager is available, 

1. Clone, build and install [ignition](https://github.com/igni-project/ignition) as instructed in its README file.

2. Enter the command `igni-samples -s` into a terminal followed by the sample to run. e.g. `igni-samples -s load-model`.
